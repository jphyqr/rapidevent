# Data Management UI

name: RapidEvents
target user: Community manager for ad hoc large event


Solution:
A responsive single-page application for managing and visualizing tabular and statistical data. 




## Running Locally

We use --force because weâ€™re working with the latest versions of Next.js 15 and React, which may have dependency conflicts with older packages. This ensures everything installs properly despite those conflicts.

```bash
npm install --force
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.





## Technical Implementation

### Core Requirements & Solutions

**Form Submission & Validation**
- Custom field system with enterprise feature previews
- Real-time validation with field-level error states
- Reusable NumberInput component handling currency, integers
- Email uniqueness validation

**Data Management & Performance**
- Server-side pagination and sorting
- Debounced search functionality
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Data revalidation patterns for real-time consistency

**Visualization**
- Age distribution analytics
- Submission timeline tracking
- Responsive charts with proper loading states

### Key Features

**Smart Form Fields**
- Extensible custom field system
- Enterprise feature previews (disabled but visible)
- Intelligent validation based on field type

**Optimized Data Grid**
- Server-side operations for large datasets
- Smooth loading states preserving table dimensions
- Intuitive sorting and filtering

**Edit Workflow**
- Compact inline editing
- Original field preservation
- Smart validation handling

### Technical Decisions

**Next.js 15**
- Server Components for heavy data operations
- Streaming for progressive loading
- Efficient component-level code splitting

**State Management**
- Server-side sorting/filtering for scalability
- Client-side state for immediate feedback
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Application level state (useContext) for darkmode and newSubmission highlighting

**Data Visualization**
- Recharts for optimized chart rendering
- Server-aggregated data for performance
- Real-time updates through revalidation

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search
- Paginated data fetching
- Progressive loading
- Optimistic updates
- Component-level code splitting

### Architecture Highlights
- Form/Table/Chart component isolation
- Server/client responsibility separation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Reusable component patterns


### Component Library: shadcn/ui
- Offers highly accessible, customizable components based on Radix UI primitives
- Provides a consistent design system while maintaining full styling control
- Zero runtime bundle size impact as components are copied into the project

### Form Management: React Hook Form + Zod
- React Hook Form provides performant form handling with minimal re-renders
- Zod enables robust TypeScript-first schema validation
- Combined approach ensures type safety from form submission through data management

### Data Visualization: Recharts
- React-centric charting library with efficient rendering
- Smooth updates for real-time data changes
- Responsive design support built-in

## Project Structure

```
app/
  layout.tsx                    #)server)- wraps providers, toats, metadata
  page.tsx                      # (server)Main SPA page: suspense boundaries
  _components/                  # Route-level components - all server with client splits. simulate network delays for skeletons
    data-form/                 # Form submission components
    data-table/               # Table visualization components
    data-chart/              # Chart visualization components
  lib/                        # Utilities and configurations
  providers/                 #useContext for app level state
     SubmissionProvider.tsx #highlighting new added row in table from form submit
     ThemePRoviderClientWrapper.tsx #dark mode
  components/                 #shared components
      shared/                #custom shared components
        number-input.tsx     #reusable number input for currency, age
      
      ui/                     #shad cn ui components
   hooks/                     #shared hooks

    validations.ts           # Zod schemas
    types.ts                # TypeScript type definitions
```

This structure:
- Co-locates components with their routes for better maintainability
- Isolates feature-specific components in _components directory
- Keeps shared utilities and types centralized


## Future Improvements
